::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

-   "Let RStudio create the required structure of a simple R package and review it."
-   "Build and install the package in RStudio."
-   "Use `roxygen2` to document functions."

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

-   "How do I collect my code together so I can reuse it and share it?"
-   "How do I make my own package(s)?"
-   "How do I integrate my function documentation into R's help pages system?"
-   "What helper tools does RStudio provide me with?"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Why should you make your own R packages?

**Reproducible research!**

An R package is the **basic unit of reusable code**.
If you want to reuse code later or want others to be able to use your code, you should put it in a package.

An R package requires four components, visualized in the folder tree below:

```
package_name/
├── DESCRIPTION              # metadata about the package
├── man/                     # function documentation (can be generated automatically)
├── NAMESPACE                # list of user-level functions in the package (can be generated automatically)
├── R/                       # R source code
└── <other_components>
```

*There are other optional components. [rOpenSci community](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html) has written a science-focused guidebook for package development, while [the "R packages" book](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html) contains all the fundamental information.*

### DESCRIPTION file

``` source
Package: package_name
Title: Brief package description
Description: Longer package description
Version: Version number(major.minor.patch)
Author: Name and email of package creator
Maintainer: Name and email of package maintainer (who to contact with issues)
License: Abbreviation for an open source license
```

The package name can only contain letters and numbers and has to start with a letter.

### .R files

Functions don't all have to be in one file or each in separate files.
How you organize them is up to you.
Suggestion: organize in a logical manner so that you know which file holds which functions.

### Making your first R package

In this lesson, we will start building a "[personal package](https://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/)".
This is meant to collect any kind of R code that is useful to *you*.
As you continue to evolve it after this lesson, you may move code that belongs to the same publication, topic or a distinct project, into their own packages.
Here we begin to realise the benefit of already documenting the functions formally earlier: We can publish more quickly, because we didn't leave much unfinished clean-up business.

To start working on this personal package, please open RStudio's `File` menu and select `New Project… > New Directory… > R Package`.
Give it a unique, but useful name.
Your own will work just fine.
Bonus points for squeezing in an `R` ;-)

Also add the `source files` we created earlier (the first versions of `center.R` and `rescale.R`), so that we have some example code right away.

<img src="fig/08-RStudio-new-package.png" alt="New package in RStudio" width="500" />

In case you have learned about version control already, it would be good practice to `create a git repository` now and `git commit` each step of building this package.

<img src="fig/08-RStudio-new-package-git.png" alt="Default package files in RStudio's Git pane" width="500" />

RStudio's "skeleton" package can already be built, using the `Build > Install and Restart` option.
Note the `library(...)` line that appears in the console.
Also, notice there is now a `package:YouRName` environment that is the parent environment to the global environment.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
search()
```

This means you can now take advantage of the console's auto-complete just like for any other package.
Type `cen` and/or `resc`, then <kbd>Tab</kbd> and test some examples like `center(c(1, 2, 3), 0)` or `rescale(c(1, 2, 3))`.

## Folder and file structure of an R package

An R package requires four components:

-   a `DESCRIPTION` file with metadata about the package
-   an `R` directory with the code
-   a `man` directory with documentation (we will create this automatically)
-   a `NAMESPACE` file listing user-level ("exported") functions in the package (we will also create this automatically)

*There are other optional components. [Read the "R packages" book](https://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html) and/or the original ["Writing R Extensions" documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-structure) for much more information.*

### .R files

Functions don't all have to be in one file or each in separate files.
How you organize them is up to you.
Suggestion: organize in a logical manner so that you know which file holds which functions.

### `DESCRIPTION` file

We used RStudio's import process to include the `.R` files we already had.
However, FAIRer (because richer in metadata) `DESCRIPTION` files can be generated with `usethis::use_description()`:

```
Package: PackageName
Type: Package
Version: 0.1.0
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Authors@R:
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com")
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: What license it uses
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

The package name can only contain letters and numbers and has to start with a letter.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Provide citation metadata in the `DESCRIPTION` file

R supports citing R packages.
Have a look at the output of `citation(YouRName)`.
Does anything seem to be missing?
If yes, how and where do you think we can add that information?

Assuming you have an ORCiD, you may want to associate your R package with it.
Find out how to add this information, and which additional changes you can make to the `DESCRIPTION` file.

## Hint

One useful resource to find the answer to such technical details is GitHub.
Search for `org:ROpenSci filename:DESCRIPTION` (this restricts your search) to a community of practice and its R packages) plus [`2019`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AROpenSci+filename%3ADESCRIPTION+2019) or [`orcid`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AROpenSci+filename%3ADESCRIPTION+orcid) for example.

:::::::::::::::::::::: solution

The date is added in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format: `date: 2018-07-12`.

ORCiDs can only be added to machine-readable `Authors@R` fields that use the `person(…)` function.
`use_description()` created this already, so that you can add your ORCiD as a `comment = c(ORCID = "…")`.

In summary: Enabling `citation()` to convert `DESCRIPTION` into a rich BibTeX snippet is a side-effect of FAIR metadata for your R package.

### Converting function documentation to help pages

Remember that we documented our functions with roxygen comments?
Let's try and look it up:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?center
help(rescale)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Why `No documentation for '…' in specified packages and libraries`? We did write it!

Why do you think the documentation of our package can not be found.
Hint: Look at the commit diff.

:::::::::::::::::::::: solution

### Solution

We did not yet tell R to actually generate the `man`ual files and folders in our package.
This needs to be done with `roxygen2::roxygenise()`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

After `Install and Restart`-ing again, looking up the documentation should work.

What exactly does `roxygen2` do?
It reads lines that begin with `#'` as the function documentation for your package.
Descriptive tags are preceded with the `@` symbol.
For example, `@param` has information about the input parameters for the function.

### Exporting "user-level" functions

We haven't talked about the `NAMESPACE` file yet!
It belongs to the package skeleton, and was set up by RStudio with an `exportPattern`.
Any file name in `R/` that matches it is automatically exported, meaning offered to users of your package in the console's tab-completion.

If you want to publish your package, but keep some functions hidden (maybe because they only do auxiliary tasks), you can delete this default file, remove the `@export` tag from the auxiliary functions, and rerun `roxygenise()`.
It's still a good idea to retain their other roxygen tags (esp. `@param` & `@return`).

Learn more about this from the ["R packages" book](https://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html).

### Finishing up

Please take a look at RStudio's `Files` panes now.
The `man` directory should now contain one LaTeX-like formatted `.Rd` file for each function.

In case you learned about Git already, also view the `.Rd` files in RStudio's `Git` pane and commit the documentation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## How would you word the commit message?

"Add docu" is a bit moot, because that's obvious from the filenames and contents.
Which other messages would better explain the "Why?", or that would be more useful when browsing the commit history later

:::::::::::::::::::::::::: hint

 -   "roxygenise() function comments into help pages" because it mentions the command you used
 -   "Integrate function documentation into R's standard help pages"
 -   "Render function documentation as R's standard help pages"

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Also, after `roxygenise()`-ing the function docu, you can tell R to run the examples.
Using R's `example()` function on another function's name saves you from scrolling down its help page, copying the example code and pasting it into the console.

```{r center-rescale-packaged-test-call, eval=FALSE}
example(center)
example(rescale)
```

## Creating a Package for Distribution

1.  Create some new functions for your tempConvert package to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit.
2.  Create a package for our `analyze` function so that it will be easy to load when more data arrives.

::::::::::::::: solution

## Solution

``` r
#' Converts Kelvin to Celsius
#'
#' This function converts input temperatures in Kelvin to Celsius.
#' @param temp_K The temperature in Kelvin.
#' @return The temperature in Celsius.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' kelvin_to_celsius(273.15)

kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp_K) {
  temp_C <- temp_K - 273.15
  temp_C
}
```

``` r
#' Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit
#'
#' This function converts input temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit.
#' @param temp_C The temperature in Celsius.
#' @return The temperature in Fahrenheit.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)

celsius_to_fahrenheit <- function(temp_C) {
  temp_F <- (temp_C * 9/5) + 32
  temp_F
}
```

``` r
#' Converts Kelvin to Fahrenheit
#'
#' This function converts input temperatures in Kelvin to Fahrenheit.
#' @param temp_K The temperature in Kelvin.
#' @return The temperature in Fahrenheit.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' kelvin_to_fahrenheit(273.15)

kelvin_to_fahrenheit <- function(temp_K) {
  temp_C <- kelvin_to_celsius(temp_K)
  temp_F <- celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_C)
  temp_F
}
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

-   A package is the basic unit of reusability in R.
-   Every package must have a DESCRIPTION file and an R directory containing code. These are created by us.
-   A NAMESPACE file is needed as well, and a man directory containing documentation, but both can be autogenerated.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This was our basic introduction to packaging up R functions.
To go on from here, remember to functionalise R code that you use repeatedly and incorporate it into your personal package.
