:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I write R code that other people can understand and use?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Keep track of who wrote your code and its intended purpose

Starting your code with an annotated description of what the code does when it is run will help you when you have to look at or change it in the future.
Just one or two lines at the beginning of the file can save you or someone else a lot of time and effort when trying to understand what a particular script does.

```{r comment1}
# This is code to replicate the analyses and figures from my 2014 Science
# paper. Code developed by Sarah Supp, Tracy Teal, and Jon Borelli
```

Also consider version-controlling your code as for example taught by [Software Carpentry's `git-novice` lessons][swc-lesson-git].
Frequent commits with explanatory, synoptic commit messages are an elegant way to comment code.
[RStudio enables this with a Git integration][rstudio-git].

### Be explicit about the requirements and dependencies of your code

Loading all of the packages that will be necessary to run your code (using `library`) is a nice way of indicating which packages are necessary to run your code.
It can be frustrating to make it two-thirds of the way through a long-running script only to find out that a dependency hasn't been installed.

```{r loadpkgs, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

Another way you can be explicit about the requirements of your code and improve its reproducibility is to limit the "hard-coding" of the input and output files for your script.
If your code will read in data from a file, define a variable early in your code that stores the path to that file.
For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
input_file <- "data/data.csv"
output_file <- "data/results.csv"

# read input
input_data <- read.csv(input_file)
# get number of samples in data
sample_number <- nrow(input_data)
# generate results
results <- some_other_function(input_file, sample_number)
# write results
write.table(results, output_file)
```

is preferable to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# check
input_data <- read.csv("data/data.csv")
# get number of samples in data
sample_number <- nrow(input_data)
# generate results
results <- some_other_function("data/data.csv", sample_number)
# write results
write.table("data/results.csv", output_file)
```

It is also worth considering what the working directory is.
If the working directory must change, it is best to do that at the beginning of the script.

## Be careful when using `setwd()`

One should exercise caution when using `setwd()`.
Changing directories in a script file can limit reproducibility:

- `setwd()` will return an error if the directory to which you're trying to change doesn't exist or if the user doesn't have the correct permissions to access that directory.
This becomes a problem when sharing scripts between users who have organized their directories differently.
- If/when your script terminates with an error, you might leave the user in a different directory than the one they started in, and if they then call the script again, this will cause further problems.
If you must use `setwd()`, it is best to put it at the top of the script to avoid these problems.
  The following error message indicates that R has failed to set the working directory you specified:

```
Error in setwd("~/path/to/working/directory") : cannot change working directory
```

It is best practice to have the user running the script begin in a consistent directory on their machine and then use relative file paths from that directory to access files (see below).

Alternatively, consider using the `here` package to set paths relative to your project root, <https://here.r-lib.org/>.
This works well with RStudio projects, but there are other ways to work with it outside of RStudio.
You might also like to see "[Ode to the here package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)" by Jenny Bryan for why you might like to use it.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Identify and segregate distinct components in your code

It's easy to annotate and mark your code using `#` or `#-` to set off sections of your code and to make finding specific parts of your code easier.
For example, it's often helpful when writing code to separate the function definitions.
If you create only one or a few custom functions in your script, put them toward the top of your code.
If you have written many functions, put them all in their own.
R file and then` source` those files.
`source` will define all of these functions so that your code can make use of them as needed.

```{r source_ex, eval=FALSE}
source("my_genius_fxns.R")
```

### Other ideas

1. Use a consistent style within your code.
For example, name all matrices something ending in `_mat`.
Consistency makes code easier to read and problems easier to spot.

2. Keep your code in bite-sized chunks.
If a single function or loop gets too long, consider looking for ways to break it into smaller pieces.

3. Don't repeat yourself--automate!
If you are repeating the same code over and over, use a loop or a function to repeat that code for you.
Needless repetition doesn't just waste time--it also increases the likelihood you'll make a costly mistake!

4. Keep all of your source files for a [project in the same directory][rstudio-project], then use relative paths as necessary to access them.
For example, use

```{r relpath, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv(file = "files/dataset-2013-01.csv", header = TRUE)
```

rather than:

```{r abspath, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv(file = "/Users/Karthik/Documents/sannic-project/files/dataset-2013-01.csv", header = TRUE)
```

5. R can run into memory issues. It is a common problem to run out of memory after running R scripts for a long time.
To inspect the objects in your current R environment, you can list the objects, search current packages, and remove objects that are currently not in use.
A good practice when running long lines of computationally intensive code is to remove temporary objects after they have served their purpose.
However, sometimes, R will not clean up unused memory for a while after you delete objects.
You can force R to tidy up its memory by using `gc()`.

```{r gc_ex, eval=FALSE}
# Sample dataset of 1000 rows
interim_object <- data.frame(
  rep(1:100, 10),
  rep(101:200, 10),
  rep(201:300, 10)
)
object.size(interim_object) # Reports the memory size allocated to the object
rm("interim_object") # Removes only the object itself and not necessarily the memory allotted to it
gc() # Force R to release memory it is no longer using
ls() # Lists all the objects in your current workspace
rm(list = ls()) # If you want to delete all the objects in the workspace and start with a clean slate
```

6. Don't save a session history (the default option in R, when it asks if you want an `RData` file).
Instead, start in a clean environment so that older objects don't remain in your environment any longer than they need to.
If that happens, it can lead to unexpected results.
*You can disable this in RStudio as well, as follows:*
Go to your menu bar, then click Tools → Global Options to open up the Options window.
![](fig/rstudio_settings.png){alt='Screenshot of the RStudio Global Options, with "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" unchecked, and "Save workspace to .RData on exit" set to "Never".'}
Make sure your settings match those highlighted in yellow.
We don't want RStudio to store the current status of our R session and reload it the next time we start R.
This might sound convenient, but for the sake of reproducibility, we want to start with a clean, empty R session every time we work.
That means that we have to record everything we do into scripts, save any data we need into files, and store outputs like images as files.
We want to get used to everything we generate in a single R session being *disposable*.
We want our scripts to be able to regenerate things we need, other than "raw materials" like data.
Instead, start in a clean environment so that older objects don't remain in your environment any longer than they need to.
If that happens, it can lead to unexpected results.

7. Wherever possible, [keep track of `sessionInfo()` somewhere][sessionInfo] in your project folder.
Session information is invaluable because it captures all the packages used in the current project.
If a newer version of a package changes the way a function behaves, you can always go back and reinstall the version that worked (Note: At least on CRAN, all older versions of packages are permanently archived).

8. Collaborate.
Grab a buddy and practice "code review".
Review is used for preparing experiments and manuscripts; why not use it for code as well?
Our code is also a major scientific achievement and the product of lots of hard work!
Reviews are built into [GitHub's Pull request feature][gh-pr].

9. Use [RStudio projects](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro.html) to manage your work.

## Challenge: Creating a Self-contained Project

We're going to create a new project in RStudio and save some data for later use:

1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
2. Click "New Directory".
3. Click "New Project".
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, _e.g._, "my\_project".
5. Click the "Create Project" button.
6. In the Files pane, click on the "New Folder" button and create a new directory called "data".
7. Download the file located at <https://github.com/adamhsparks/2025-11-13-COMBINE-WA-morning/blob/main/episodes/data/SAFI_clean.csv> and save it in the "data" directory you just created in your new project folder.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The simplest way to open an RStudio project once it has been created is to click through your file system to get to the directory where it was saved and double click on the `.Rproj` file.
This will open RStudio and start your R session in the same directory as the `.Rproj` file.
All your data, plots and scripts will now be relative to the project directory.
RStudio projects have the added benefit of allowing you to open multiple projects at the same time each open to its own project directory.
This allows you to keep multiple projects open without them interfering with each other.
