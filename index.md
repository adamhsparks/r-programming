The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to R is built around a common scientific task: data analysis.
I've focused on best practices for R programming to start, included some use of {knitr}, RMarkdown and Quarto and finish building R packages.

My real goal isn't to teach you how to use R, but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on.

Learners need to understand the concepts of files and directories (including the working directory).
I will use RStudio to teach this lesson, but it is not required.
In fact, I put this lesson together using Neovim.
