# Intermediate R - Literate Programming and Package Development

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teach foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
This is a custom lesson built for the COMBINE WA Intermediate R workshop held 2025-11-13 at the Pawsey Centre.
The full lesson website can be viewed [here](https//adamhsparks.github.io/2025-11-13-COMBINE-WA-morning).
Making changes in this GitHub repository allows us to change the content of the lesson website.

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code to perform a data analysis.
R is used to teach these skills because it is a commonly used programming language in many scientific disciplines.
However, the emphasis is not on teaching every aspect of R, but instead on language agnostic principles like automation with loops and encapsulation with functions (see [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) to learn more).
