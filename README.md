# r-programming

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teach foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
This GitHub repository generates a modified version of the Software Carpentry lesson website "Introduction to R for non-programmers using inflammation data."
The full [lesson website can be viewed here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/); this [modified lesson can be viewed here](https://adamhsparks.github.io/r-programming).
Making changes in this GitHub repository allows us to change the content of the lesson website.

The following people are maintainers for this lesson, and are responsible for determining which changes to incorporate into the lesson:

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code to perform a data analysis.
R is used to teach these skills because it is a commonly used programming language in many scientific disciplines.
However, the emphasis is not on teaching every aspect of R, but instead on language agnostic principles like automation with loops and encapsulation with functions (see [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) to learn more).
This lesson is a translation of the [Python version](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation), and is also available in [MATLAB](https://github.com/swcarpentry/matlab-novice-inflammation).
